# Candy Coins 

An example [CorDapp](http://www.corda.net/develop/index.html) where kids can trade sweets 

In the Candy Coins world the following rules apply:

* Kids get new sweets each week and on special occasions 
* Sweets are valued as follows:
    * 1 chocolate bar = 3 gobstoppers 
    * 1 gobstopper = 5 jellybeans
* chocolate bars can be swapped for marbles, which can be used to buy other things like toys (really 
marbles are the cash)
* the chocolate bar to marble exchange rate changes daily 
* sweets can be eaten!
